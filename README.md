qarally
=======

My first AngularJS app.

This is an internal tool for QA staff to perform test cases using Rally (rallydev.com). Rally is very good for product owners and developers. The UX for QA Testers to perform tests is burdensome. A test that takes 30 seconds to perform often takes 90 seconds to negotiate Rally's UX. This "quick and dirty" internal tool is meant to make their efforts faster. For me, a quick and dirty internal tool is an ideal place to give AngularJS a shot.

** It is probably over engineered! I don't spend a lot of time on heavy client-side apps and I'm kind of stepping past the boundaries of too much to figure out where the line is.

TODO list

Research Topics
===============

1 How to discover template errors?
  * such as misspelled directives or expressions
  * discover at dev/build time (node script?)
  * discover at runtime (catch errors and report to console even)


2 Service to mock fragility?
